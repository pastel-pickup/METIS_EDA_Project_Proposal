# Flood Risk of Top 10 Busiest NYC Subway Stations
Mai Tran

# Abstract
In September 2021, New York City (NYC) experienced a historic flood that submerged some NYC subway stations, damaged subway infracstructure, surrounding properties, and ultimately the livelihood of New Yorkers. In order to better prepare for the next historic flooding incident, it is important to evaluate flood risk of the top 10 busiest NYC subway stations. Flood risk is evaluated based on the rainiest season in NYC and top 10 busiest NYC subway stations with the most flood incidents reported.

# Design
The design of the project essentially merges the top results of three data sets: rain data, NYC subway traffic data, and flood incidents data. Each of the following steps is a filtering process for each data set: 
  1) Find the rainiest month or season in NYC using recent weather data
  2) Find the top 10 busiest NYC subway stations during the rainiest season
  3) Find the top 10 busiest NYC subway stations with the most flood incidents during the rainiest season

# Data
1) Rain data: 
2) Subway traffic data:
