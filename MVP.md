Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

1) Successfully determined the raininest month, which is July, in all 5 NYC boroughs in the past 3 years (2019-2021).

2) Another business application of this project: targeted advertising for rain apparel such as rainboots, umbrellas, ponchos, etc. 


Next Steps: 
4) Top 10 Busiest NYC Subway Stations During July
5) Geo-mapping with 311 Street Flood Data (if there is time)
